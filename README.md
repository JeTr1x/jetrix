Our valiadtor is now exited, due to approaching end of goerli testnet

Also participtaing in many others, where I cannot provide any links, like:
-Kroma
-Quai node + miner
-Avail full and light node
-Namada participated in all testnets
-Penumbra participated in all testnets
and many others

And participated in projects which are in mainnet now, but for some reasons I am not validating or running nodes/miners on them:
-IronFish
-Stride
-Haqq
-Nois
-Massa
-StaFi
-Nolus
and many others, just cant remember all;)
All projects I am part of, I always take seriously and try to get best servers, and best service, upgrading nodes as fast as possible, reacting for some issues fast ( I have grafana with all my servers for monitoring and my own tg bot for notification).
